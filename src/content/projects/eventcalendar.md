-   Event Calendar is an event ticketing website built on **Next.js** that allows hosts to create and manage events while enabling users to easily browse, filter, and purchase tickets.
-   Thoughtfully engineered using **server-side rendering and lazy loading**, resulting in a fast and responsive user experience with great web vitals.
